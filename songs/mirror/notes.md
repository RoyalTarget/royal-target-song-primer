# Mirror — Notes & Interpretation

## Dramaturgy (overview)
Cyclical arc: **Verse1 → Pre(2) → Verse2 → Pre(4) → Chorus (single) → return**.  
One cathartic peak only; end remains open.

## Text particularities (fixed)
- “Words – some hurt – and I don’t know why” → parenthesis required.
- “ends up in a mess” → sung without “it”.
- “life fading out” → deliberate musical/filmic metaphor.
- “…bits and pieces… they’re hard to earn” → unusual but intentional (echo with “(slight) return”).

## Stylistic guardrails
- No smoothing; fragmentary Post-Punk / New-Wave feel.
- **Chorus occurs once** (no repeat).
- Mirror motif drives the Pre-Chorus placement.

## Practical cue
After **F#m–D–Dm** (chorus extension), return to **A–Bm** (Verse), then close with the Mirror Pre as outro.
