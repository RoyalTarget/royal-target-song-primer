## About Royal Target
To play music is so much fun and allows me to dive into a whole new world and switch off completely. With my songs I try to express things that touch me, and the lyrics and melodies often come up on the sofa, with the guitar in my hand and a cold beer on the table.  

As a pure music listener over the years, I have been influenced by and cannot deny bands like **The Smiths, The Cure, Joy Division, Pixies, Blur, Oasis, Stone Roses, and earlier The Beatles**.  
I play a **Fender Telecaster**, produce with **Logic Pro X**, and am still in the project stage at the moment ‚Äì but maybe *Royal Target* will become a full band soon.  

### New Songs
- **The Ocean** (Summer 2021)  
  Describes the difficulties and failures in dealing with things. Even if you try everything, you are ignored and drown in the "ocean" of external circumstances. Inspired by 80s basslines and atmospheres.  

- **Suddenly** (Summer 2021)  
  A song about suddenly discovering your love for a person. The bassline (inspired by Peter Hook) carries through the whole song, even during chord changes.  

Both songs were written and recorded as a **‚Äúone man band‚Äù in the basement** ‚Äì just for fun, and I hope you have fun with them too!
