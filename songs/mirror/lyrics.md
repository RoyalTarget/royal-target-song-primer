# Mirror — Lyrics & Chords

## Verse 1
A   A   Bm  Bm  
It’s been around a bit, quite a while  
A   A   Bm  Bm  
Tiny misunderstanding, hopes a tad too high  
A   A   Bm  Bm  
fairly well, wiped out, and some cry  
A   A   Bm  Bm  
Words – some hurt – and I don’t know why  

## Pre-Chorus (short – 2 lines)
D   Bm  A   A  
Look in the mirror, see no face but a crowd  
D   Bm  A   A  
Look in the mirror, see my life fading out  

## Verse 2
A   A   Bm  Bm  
Tweak it a bit, but I couldn’t care less  
A   A   Bm  Bm  
Choice matters over need, end up in a mess  
A   A   Bm  Bm  
no mean – feat – and a slight return  
A   A   Bm  Bm  
grab bits and pieces, bits and pieces they’re hard to earn  

## Pre-Chorus (full – 4 lines)
D   Bm  A   A  
Look in the mirror, see no face but a crowd  
D   Bm  A   A  
Look in the mirror, see my life fading out  
D   Bm  A   A  
Look in the mirror, see no face but a crowd  
D   Bm  A   A  
Look in the mirror, hear my words far too loud
