# Mirror — Notes & Interpretation (extended)

## Dramaturgy
- Cyclical structure: **Verse 1 → Pre (2 lines) → Verse 2 → Pre (4 lines) → Chorus (single) → return (Verse A–Bm) → Outro Pre (Mirror motif)**.
- **Verse 1**: Themes of hurt, misunderstandings, disappointment.  
- **Pre (short)**: Mirror introduced as motif (self-reflection, alienation).  
- **Verse 2**: More introspective, self-critical (“choice over need”, “slight return”), highlighting inner chaos.  
- **Pre (full)**: Mirror image fully developed → no identity, fading life, words too loud.  
- **Chorus (single)**: Catharsis, the only outburst (“And I sing it so loud”), followed by abrupt cut (F#m–D–Dm).  
- **Ending**: Return to Verse chords (A–Bm) and final Mirror Pre → open, unresolved.

## Text particularities (fixed)
- **Parenthesis**: “Words – some hurt – and I don’t know why” → must stay as is.  
- **Ellipsis in phrasing**: “ends up in a mess” sung without “it”.  
- **Metaphor**: “life fading out” = deliberate filmic/musical image, not to be replaced.  
- **Word choice**: “bits and pieces … hard to earn” = unusual, but intentional (echo on “(slight) return”).  

## Stylistic guardrails
- Intonation should remain fragmented, not polished.  
- Post-Punk / New Wave character is essential.  
- **Chorus occurs once only** — that’s a structural decision, not to be “fixed”.  

## Interpretative cues
- **Mirror** = confrontation with absence of self / alienation.  
- **Chorus loudness** = single cathartic release, then collapse.  
- **Return to Verse** = cycle continues, no resolution.  
- **Dramaturgy** = circular, ending mirrors the beginning (mirror as a theme).
